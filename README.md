# BoookTrackerModel-for-SonarAudiobooks-
This repository focuses on a TTS-based instruction model to guide users, including the visually impaired, in positioning cameras relative to objects like books. Using real-time YOLO detection, it provides spoken instructions such as “move closer” or “move left” to help align objects. Implementations are available in Python and Flutter.
